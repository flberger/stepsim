"""StepSim - Python Step-based Simulation Package

   Copyright 2011 Florian Berger <fberger@florian-berger.de>

   StepSim computes step-by-step simulations of a graph of containers and
   converterts.

   First create the containers:

   >>> import stepsim
   >>> cashbox = stepsim.Container("cashbox", "EUR", 10)
   >>> storage = stepsim.Container("storage", "parts")

   Then create a converter and set up the draw-deliver-ratio:

   >>> buyer = stepsim.Converter("buyer", storage, 1)
   >>> buyer.draw_from(cashbox, 3)
   Adding source 'cashbox', drawing 3 EUR per step.

   Now we are ready to create a simulation:

   >>> s = stepsim.Simulation()
   >>> s.add_converter(buyer)
   Adding converter 'buyer' to simulation.

   You can step through simulations or simply let it run until an Exception
   occurs:

   >>> s.run()
   Starting simulation.
   Next step.
   buyer drawing 3 EUR from cashbox. cashbox has 7 EUR left now.
   buyer delivering 1 parts to storage. storage stock is 1 parts now.
   Next step.
   buyer drawing 3 EUR from cashbox. cashbox has 4 EUR left now.
   buyer delivering 1 parts to storage. storage stock is 2 parts now.
   Next step.
   buyer drawing 3 EUR from cashbox. cashbox has 1 EUR left now.
   buyer delivering 1 parts to storage. storage stock is 3 parts now.
   Next step.
   Exception while executing step in <buyer: converting from ['cashbox'] to storage>
   Simulation finished.
